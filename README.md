# üåê Scaled Intimacy Simulation

An agent-based model exploring how social networks maintain intimacy at scale through presence capacity, reciprocity, vulnerability, and memory dynamics.

## Overview

This simulation models how agents form and maintain meaningful connections within overlapping social pods, navigating the tensions between:
- **Presence capacity** limits (how many connections we can actively maintain)
- **Reciprocity** expectations (interaction loops that need closing)
- **Vulnerability** thresholds (trust-based disclosure)
- **Memory decay** (how relationships fade without reinforcement)

## Features

### Interactive Web Visualization
- Real-time network visualization with force-directed physics
- Adjustable parameters (agent count, pod size, pulse cycles)
- Live metrics tracking (SII, presence density, reciprocity index, memory retention)
- Quiet/loud phase alternation showing interaction rhythm effects

### Python Implementation (Mesa Framework)
- Full agent-based model using Mesa, NetworkX, and NumPy
- Overlapping pod structure (simulating friend groups, communities)
- Exponential memory trace decay
- Reciprocity loop tracking
- Trust cascades and breach events
- Systemic Intimacy Index (SII) composite metric

## Quick Start

### Web Version

```

## Key Metrics

- **SII (Systemic Intimacy Index)**: Overall system health composite
- **PD (Presence Density)**: Average meaningful ties per agent
- **RI (Reciprocity Index)**: Fraction of completed interaction loops
- **VH (Variability Homeostasis)**: Novelty vs. destabilization balance
- **VS (Vulnerability Safety)**: Safe disclosure rate
- **MR (Memory Retention)**: Average trace strength
- **RB (Rhythm Balance)**: Quiet-to-loud phase ratio quality

## Model Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| N | 100 | Number of agents |
| PC | 7 | Presence capacity (max active ties) |
| RR | 4 | Reciprocity radius |
| VT | 0.5 | Vulnerability threshold |
| MD | 20 | Memory decay constant |
| Q | 10 | Quiet phase duration (cycles) |
| L | 4 | Loud phase duration (cycles) |

## Use Cases

- Exploring optimal social network architecture
